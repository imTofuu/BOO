# BOO ECS

## Description
BOO was created to be included in a game engine project. Ease of use was 
preferred over performance as this is my first real attempt at a larger 
project. The goal is to create a simple ECS system that can be used in game 
engine projects.

## Features
- Entity creation and deletion
- Adding, getting and removing components from entities
- Support for custom component types without macro registration

Features planned for future releases are:

- Systems
- Prefabs
- Component sharing
- Entity hierarchies
